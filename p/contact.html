			<p>Hey there! It’s Tolga, I’m a student at <a href="http://www.yildiz.edu.tr/en/" target="_blank">Yildiz Technical University</a>, department of Computer Engineering. 
			Coding quickly became a passion for me and I didn't wait for the university to get into the interesting lessons so I started learning stuff myself on the internet.</p>

			<p>I started developing this game 4th of August, 2014. I spend most of my time on the project, I enjoy it a lot. 
			I've always loved fast-paced games which need sharp skills and quick reaction times.</p>

			<p>You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/70LGA" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/naezith/" target="_blank">Steam</a> 
			and you can also send an email to <span>&#116;&#111;&#108;&#103;&#97;&#97;&#121;&#64;&#108;&#105;&#118;&#101;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</span>, have a nice day!</p>
